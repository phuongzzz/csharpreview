# .Net building blocks

## 3 Key topics

- CLR: Common Language Runtime: 
  - locate, load, manage .Net object
  - takes care low level details (memory management, application hosting,...****)
- CTS: Common Type System:
  - CTS specification fully describe **all possible data types** and **all programming constructs** supported by runtime
  - Specifies how these entities can interact with each other, how they are represented in the .NET metadata format
- CLS: Common Language Specification:
  - Not all .NET language support every feature defined by the CTS
  - CLS is related specification that defines a subset of **common types** and **programming constructs** that all .NET programming language agree on
- The Relation:
  - CLR = CLI = CTS + CLS + JIT + VES

## BCL: Base Class Libraries

- Available to all .NET programming languages
- Encapsulates some primitives like:
  - thread
  - IO
  - graphical rendering system
  - interaction with external hardware devices
  - services used by real world apps
- Define types that can be used to build any type of software application

## Managed vs Unmanaged Code

- The code targeting the .NET runtime is called **managed code**
  - It is the code that **compilers** create, run on **CLR**
  - Remember: "My code is managed by the CLR" :)
  - *C# and VB.NET can only provided managed code*
- The binary unit that contains the managed code is called **assembly**
- The code that cannot be directly hosted by the .NET runtime is called **unmanaged code**
  - compiles straight to machine code (like C/C++ compilers)
  - => non-portable
  - Can't use CLR services (memory management, garbage collection)

## .NET Assemblies

- Flow:
  - (C# | Perl.NET) ====> (C# | Perl.NET Compiler) ====> Intermediate Language (IL) + Metadata (*.dll or *.exe)
- IL = MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) = CIL (Common Intermediate Language) (platform-agnostic code)
- CIL ~ Java bytecode
- When `*.dll` or `*.exe` has been created using .NET compiler, the binary is called assembly
- An Assembly contains CIL and Metadata
- Assemblies are also described using metadata, called *manifest*

### JIT

- aka Dynamic translation
- for improving the runtime performance of a computer program
- Drawbacks:
  - *startup time delay*
- Advantages:
  - The compilation can be optimized
  - System is able to collect statistics

### VES (Virtual Execution System)

- provides an environment for executing managed code

### CIL

- Each .NET compilers for different languages compiles nearly identical CIL instructions
- CIL code must be compiled before use
- CIL ====> JIT Compiler ===> CPU instructions (machine code)
- Jitter cache the result in memory

### .NET Type Metadata

- describe every type defined in the binary (language-agnostic)
- describe members of each type
- Emitting latest + greatest metadata is the job of compiler

### Assembly Manifest

- describe the assembly itself
- also the job of the compiler


## CTS

- **type** is simply a general term used to refer to a member from the set (class, interface, structure, enumeration, delegate)
- **CTS (Common Type System)** is a formal specification that documents how types must be defined in order to hosted by the CLR

### 5 types formalized & defined in CTS

- Class Types:
  - composed by any  number of **members** (constructor, properties, methods, events)
  - **data points** (field)
- Interface Types
  - Named collection of **abstract member definitions**
- Structure Types
  - *Can be thought of as a lightweight class type having value-based semantic*
  - best for modeling *geometric* and **mathematical** data
  - Can have
    - fields
    - parameterized constructor
    - methods
- Enumerations
  - For grouping name-value pairs
  - Each item is 32-bit integer by default
  - Should derive from common base class: `System.Enum`
- Delegate
  - type-safe, C-style function pointer
  - it a class derives from `System.MulticastDelegate`
  - intrinsic support for *multicasting* and *asynchronous method invocation*


### CTS Type Members

### Intrinsic CTS Data Types

- All .NET language keywords ultimately resolve to the same CTS type defined in an `mscorlib.dll` assembly

## CLS (Common Language Specification)

- **CLS** is a set of rules that describe in vivid details the minimal and complete set of features a given .NET-aware compiler must support to produce code that can be hosted by CLR
- *CLS can be thought as a subset of the full functionality defined by the CTS*
- CTS's Rules:
  - *CTS rules apply only to those parts of a type that are exposed outside the defining assembly*
- CLS Compliance

## CLR

- *runtime*: a collection of services that are required to execute a given compiled unit of code

## Other

- *namespace*: grouping of semantically related types contained in an assembly or possibly spread across multiple related assemblies
- accessing namespace:
  - `using`
  - *fully qualified name*: `System.Console.WriteLine`

# Data Types

- in C#, data types keyword is the shorthand notations for full-blown types in the `System` namespace
- `int myAge= 22;`: declare and initialize variables
- **Intrinsic Data Types:**

  - support default constructor
  - allows create a variable using `new` keyword, which automatically sets the variable to its default value
  - ex:
    - `bool b = new bool();`
    - `int i = new int();`
  - parsing values from `String`
    - `int.Parse(your_string);`

## String

- Some members:
  - Length
  - Compare()
  - Contains()
  - Equals()
  - Format()
  - Insert()
  - PadLeft()
  - PadRight()
  - Remove()
  - Replace()
  - Split()
  - Trim()
  - ToUpper()
  - ToLower()
- Concatenation
  - `+` (actually, this symbol will call: `String.Concat()`)
- Escape Characters:
  - `\`
- Verbatim string
  - `@"phuong\homie\porsche"`
  - disable the processing of literal's escape characters
  - to insert `"`, must use: `""`
- Comparing
  - Although `string` is object, comparing string is just compare the value of *string object*
- Immutable
  - string **can not be changed**
- Interpolation
  - insert variable to string
- `StringBuilder`
  - make strings are mutable

## Type Conversion

- Widening:
  - no data loss
  - implicit
  - example: `short` ====> `int` (widen short to int)
  - is the term used to define an ***implicit upward cast***
- Narrowing
  - data loss
  - *must* be explicit cast: `(short) myNumber`
  - if not explicit ====> compiler error
- `checked` keyword
  - using when overflow happens!
- `unchecked` keyword
  - using when overflow happens
  - set `checked` project-wide
- Implicitly typed local variable
  - `var` keyword
  - compiler infer the data type of this based on initial value
  - Restrictions of `var`:
    - ***just for local variable***
      - and that variable must have initial value
      - this initial value must **not** be null
    - do not use for
      - return value `public var Add(var1, var2) //illegal`
      - parameters
      - field data
  - Implicit typing results in strongly typed data
    - can be understand as "dynamic typing"
    - can not assign another type after declare
      - `var s = "phuong is here"`
      - `s = "phuong is not here" // legal`
      - `s = 22 // illegal`
  - Why use `var`?
    - LINQ, and just use when working with LINQ!

---

# Method

- By default, parameters sent to function is by **value**

- `out` modifier: 

  - ```c#
    static void Add(int x, int y, out int ans) {
      ans = x + y;
    }
    ```

  - method use `out` must assign this parameter a value before exit

  - no need to initialize value for `out` parameter before use

  - When to use?

    - when caller need to obtain multiple output on single method call

- `ref` modifier

  - references type **must be initialized** before passing to the function

- `params` modifier

  - pass variable number of identically typed parameters as single logical variable

  - ```C#
    static double CalculateAverage(params double[] values) {
      for (int i = 0; i < values.Length; i++)
    	sum += values[i];
      return (sum / values.Length);
    }

    // call
    double average;
    average = CalculateAverage(4.0, 3.2, 5.7, 64.22, 87.2);
    Console.WriteLine("Average of data is: {0}", average);
    ```

- *optional parameter*

  - ```C#
    static void ErrorLog(string message, string owner = "programmer") {
      // method implementaion
    }

    // call 
    ErrorLog("syntax error"); // legal
    ErrorLog("Logic error", "phuong") // also legal
    ```

  - value for optional parameters **must be known** at compile time and **can not be resolved** at runtime

- named parameters

  - allow to invoke a method by specifying parameters values in any order

  - ```c#
    static void DisplayFancyMessage(ConsoleColor textColor, ConsoleColor backgroundColor, string message) {
      // method implementation
    }

    // call
    DisplayFancyMessage(message: "Hello, World", textColor: ConsoleColor.Red, backgroundColor: ConsoleColor.White)
    ```

  - named parameter must be put at the end of method call (after all positional parameters call)

  - When to use?

    - using with optional parameters

## Overloading

- same name, different number (or type) of parameters

---

# Array

- Normal way:

  - `int[] myInts = new int[3] {1,2,3};`
  - `int[] myInts = new int[2] {1,2,3,4} // illegal`
  - `string[] stringArray = new string[] { "one", "two", "three" }` 

- Implicit  typed local array

  - for allocating new array without specifying type
  - ex:
    - `var a = new [] {1,2,3,4} // a is int[]`

- **can not mixed type in array***

  - => can use array of object

- Multidimensional

  - ```C#
    // rectangular
    int[,] myMatrix;
    myMatrix = new int[3,4];

    // jagged
    int[][] myJagArray = new int [5][];
    ```

- Some array's method

  - `Clear()`: set member to `null`, `0` or `false`
  - `CopyTo()`: copy elements from source array ====> destination array
  - `Length`: number of items in array
  - `Rank`: the dimension of array
  - `Reverse()`: (only with 1 dimension array)
  - `Sort()`: sort with intrinsic data types

---

# Enum

- value type, a set of key-value pairs
- value is integer by default (can be changed)
- flags used for bit-used



---

# Value types vs References types

- `System.ValueType`: allocate on **stack**. Data that are allocated on **stack** is:
  - created and destroyed quickly
  - lifetime is determined by scope
- Data that are allocated on **heap** is:
  - monitored by .NET garbage collector
  - lifetime is determined by many factors

## The assignment operator

- Assign one value type to another, a member-by-member copy of the field  data is achieved

  - ex: 
    - `int`: the only member to be copied is numerical value
    - `Point` (a structure, not a class): x -> x, y->y

- Assignment operator for the ref type

  - ex:

    - ```c#
      // Point now is a class, not a struct
      Point p1 = new Point(10,2);
      Point p2 = p1;

      // Now, p2 and p1 point to the same object on the heap
      // Change p1 or p2 will affect to other
      ```

## Value type contain ref type

# Collection

- Generic containers are often favored over non generic:
  - greater type safety
  - performance

## Array

- the most **primitive** container
- **fixed** size
- To deal with these limitations, BCL ship a number of namespaces containing *collection classes*
- *Collection classes* are built to dynamically resize on the fly when *insert* or *remove*
- 2 big categories of collections:
  - Non generic collection (`System.Collections` namespace)
    - typically work with `System.Object` type
    - loosely typed
  - Generic collection (`System.Collections.Generic` namespace)
    - type-safe
    - `List<T>`: `<T>` is *type parameter*

## Non-generic (`System.Collections`)

- Some of collections:
  - `ArrayList`
    - dynamically sized collection of object, listed in sequential order
  - `BitArray`
    - compact array of bit values, which are represented as Booleans
  - `HashTable`
    - collection of key-value pairs
    - organized based on the hash code of the key
  - `Queue`
    - FIFO collection of object
  - `SortedList`
    - key-value pairs collection
    - sorted by the keys
    - accessible by key and by index
  - `Stack`
    - LIFO
- **Not use this type of collections much nowadays!!**

## Generic Collections (`System.Collections.Generic`)
