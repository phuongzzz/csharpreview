# .Net building blocks

## 3 Key topics

- CLR: Common Language Runtime: 
  - locate, load, manage .Net object
  - takes care low level details (memory management, application hosting,...****)
- CTS: Common Type System:
  - CTS specification fully describe **all possible data types** and **all programming constructs** supported by runtime
  - Specifies how these entities can interact with each other, how they are represented in the .NET metadata format
- CLS: Common Language Specification:
  - Not all .NET language support every feature defined by the CTS
  - CLS is related specification that defines a subset of **common types** and **programming constructs** that all .NET programming language agree on

## BCL: Base Class Libraries

- Available to all .NET programming languages
- Encapsulates some primitives like:
  - thread
  - IO
  - graphical rendering system
  - interaction with external hardware devices
  - services used by real world apps
- Define types that can be used to build any type of software application

## Managed vs Unmanaged Code

- The code targeting the .NET runtime is called **managed code**
  - It is the code that **compilers** create, run on **CLR**
  - Remember: "My code is managed by the CLR" :)
  - *C# and VB.NET can only provided managed code*
- The binary unit that contains the managed code is called **assembly**
- The code that cannot be directly hosted by the .NET runtime is called **unmanaged code**
  - compiles straight to machine code (like C/C++ compilers)
  - => non-portable
  - Can't use CLR services (memory management, garbage collection)

## .NET Assemblies

- Flow:
  - (C# | Perl.NET) ====> (C# | Perl.NET Compiler) ====> Intermediate Language (IL) + Metadata (*.dll or *.exe)
- IL = MSIL (Microsoft Intermediate Language) = CIL (Common Intermediate Language) (platform-agnostic code)
- CIL ~ Java bytecode
- When `*.dll` or `*.exe` has been created using .NET compiler, the binary is called assembly
- An Assembly contains CIL and Metadata
- Assemblies are also described using metadata, called *manifest*

### CIL

- Each .NET compilers for different languages compiles nearly identical CIL instructions
- CIL code must be compiled before use
- CIL ==JIT Compiler==> CPU instructions (machine code)
- Jitter cache the result in memory

### .NET Type Metadata

- describe every type defined in the binary
- describe members of each type
- Emitting latest + greatest metadata is the job of compiler

### Assembly Manifest

- describe the assembly itself
- also the job of the compiler


## CTS

- **type** is simply a general term used to refer to a member from the set (class, interface, structure, enumeration, delegate)
- **CTS (Common Type System)** is a formal specification that documents how types must be defined in order to hosted by the CLR

### 5 types formalized & defined in CTS

- Class Types:
  - composed by any  number of **members** (constructor, properties, methods, events)
  - **data points** (field)
- Interface Types
  - Named collection of **abstract member definitions**
- Structure Types
  - *Can be thought of as a lightweight class type having value-based semantic*
  - best for modeling *geometric* and **mathematical** data
  - Can have
    - fields
    - parameterized constructor
    - methods
- Enumerations
  - For grouping name-value pairs
  - Each item is 32-bit integer by default
  - Should derive from common base class: `System.Enum`
- Delegate
  - type-safe, C-style function pointer
  - it a class derives from `System.MulticastDelegate`
  - intrinsic support for *multicasting* and *asynchronous method invocation*
